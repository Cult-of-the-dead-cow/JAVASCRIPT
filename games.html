<th><h3>1. Cornhole</h3></th>

<font size=4px>
<p> Cornhole (also known as Papi Hole, dummy boards, bean bag toss, dadhole, doghouse, Baggo or bags) is an international lawn game in 
which players take turns throwing bags of corn (or bean bags) at a raised platform with a hole in the far end. A bag in the hole scores 3 points, 
while one on the platform scores 1 point. Play continues until a team or player reaches (or exceeds) the score of 21.

Rules and regulations:-

Equipment and court layout.<br>
Cornhole matches are played with two sets of bags, two platforms and two to four players.

There are four bags to a set. Each set should be identifiable from the other; different colours work well. 
The American Cornhole Organization Official Cornhole Rules call for double-seamed fabric bags measuring 6 by 6 inches (150 by 150 mm) and weighing 
15 to 16 ounces (430 to 450 g). Bags should be filled with dried corn kernels. The final weight of the bag may vary due to the material of the bag itself.
Each platform is 2 by 4 feet (0.61 by 1.22 m), with a 6-inch (150 mm) hole centered 9 inches (230 mm) from the top. 
Each platform should be angled with the top edge of the playing surface 12 inches (300 mm) above the ground, and the bottom edge 3–4 inches 
(76–102 mm) above the ground. A regular court places the holes 33 feet (10 m) apart, or 27 feet (8.2 m) between the bottoms of the platforms. 
Shorter distances can be used when younger players are participating or there is not sufficient room.
Bags are tossed from the pitcher's box which is the rectangular area directly to the left or right of a platform. 
The bottom of the platform forms the foul line. Players may not step over the foul line while pitching.

<th><h3>2. Booklets To Fill In</h3></th>
<font size=4px>
<p> Great for the reception tables,these little booklets will come in handy for the couple after the wedding.   
Print them up on card-stock at home and place binder rings on them.These little books of advice could cover such topics as: 
What should we do on date nights? What should we name our first child? How should we celebrate our first anniversary? What’s the secret to a happy marriage?

<h4>How To Play:</h4>
There is really no playing involved so this makes it great for the shy guests. Just be sure to leave a pen so guests can write their advice to you.  
This is also a perfect idea for a guest book alternative.

<th><h3>3. The Shoe Game</h3></th>
<font size=4px>
<p> The shoe game is fun and “solely” for your guests enjoyment.  The couple gets to answer questions about their relationship by holding up 
the correct shoe that answers the question.

<h4>How To Play:</h4>
 The couple sits back to back so they don’t see their partners’ answers. They swap a shoe with each other so they are holding one of each. 
Someone asks the couple a series of questions about their relationship (ranging from the sweet questions such as“Who said ‘I love you’ first?” 
to funny questions designed to get laughs “Who is the better driver?” to embarrassing questions such as “Who has the smelliest feet?”). 
The couple answers the question by holding up the corresponding shoe.
