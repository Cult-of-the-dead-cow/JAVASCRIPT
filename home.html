  <p> As I am a destination wedding planner for India, here is the way to arrive at costing for a destination wedding in India <br>
1. Please finalise your guest list first. It is the first thing which will decide your budget. Please don't keep it vague like 100 to 200. It means almost double. 
Try to really think how many guests you think would really come all the way from there places to your chosen wedding destination. Its very rare that wedding 
guests list increases. It mostly decreases with last minute cancellations, flights, visas and so on. And don't forget, Indian Weddings happen in a season and we 
all get multi invites to attend weddings on same dates! So first thing, get down to your REAL guests list. <br>
2. Chose a destination which is logistically viable for you and your guests. Guests come by all means and you may or may not be paying for flights or trains. 
Keep it simple for guests. And if its not, your destination better be worth all the effort. <br>
3. Next comes hotel. There are all categories of hotel and per room per night for two people may cost anywhere between INR 6000 to INR 50000 depending on a
 3 star or 4 star or 5 star or uber luxurious hotel in India. <br>
4. Will you pay for all meals or only for Gala Dinners is next element affecting your cost. Opt for buffet lunch and gala dinner to save on cost. 
Buffet lunch can cost INR 800 to INR 2000 or more and Gala Dinner can cost INR 2000 to INR 4000 or more. plus taxes. <br>
5. And then there are wedding arrangements which includes decor, florals, lighting, procession, entertainment, makeup artist, wedding planner charges and so on. 
It costs at least 3 to 20 lakh per event. Weddings are subjective and so are the arrangements. <br>
