<p> The engagement ceremony is an important pre-wedding ritual in Indian cultures where the would be bride and the bride-groom to be come face 
to face and are formally betrothed to each other by their families. The Hindu tradition of "Vagdanam" dates back to vedic ages and it involves
the groom's family giving their words to the bride's family that they will accept their daughter and will be responsible for her future well-being. 
It is sort of an exchange of pledges between the families and a chance of getting to know each others customs or rituals. In historic times, 
this ritual involved elaborate announcements in case of Royalties. In Rajput's traditions, this betrothal generally takes place soon after the birth 
of a girl so as to ward of other suitors.
Engagement ceremonies are uniform across most religion and ethnicities across India differing in nuances and details of the rituals.</p>
