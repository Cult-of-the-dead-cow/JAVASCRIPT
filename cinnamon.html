<p> A cinnamon roll (also cinnamon bun, cinnamon swirl, cinnamon Danish, and cinnamon snail) is a sweet roll served commonly in Northern Europe 
and North America. In Denmark, it is the most common form of wienerbr√∏d ('Vienna Bread') and is known as Kanelsnegl; 'cinnamon snail'. 
In North America, its common use is for breakfast or dessert. Its main ingredients are flour, cinnamon, sugar, and butter, which provide 
a robust and sweet flavor. In some places, it is eaten as a breakfast food and is often served with cream cheese or icing. </p>
