There are many times that a day calls for a big dessert. A huge slab of chocolate cake, four scoops of ice cream or a stack of steaming hot cookies. 
Other times, a mini dessert hits the spot perfectly. Here are three delicious ideas for dessert shooters that satisfy your sweet tooth and are perfect
 to make for your family. And if its one of those days, a day where a large dessert is needed, just go ahead and have two.

Betty Crocker Reese Dessert Bar Mix is so delicious! I am a sucker for chocolate-peanut butter anything, and this no-bake dessert is decadent,
 creamy and amazing. Instead of putting it into the pan included with the mix, I layered it in shooter glasses and put the glasses into the refrigerator 
 to set according to the directions. When set, top with whipped cream and crumbled peanut butter candies and, oh my, its delicious!

Cool, fudgy simplicity at its best! Layer Betty Crocker Fudge Brownies with mint chocolate chip ice cream and chocolate sauce. 
Top with whipped cream and crushed mint chocolate candies. Perfection. Dessert shooters are a great way to tap into your creative side and experiment 
with flavor combinations.
